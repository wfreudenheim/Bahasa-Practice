## Implementation Rules & Best Practices

### Vocabulary Management
1. File Organization
   - Store vocabulary files in repository
   - Use clear folder hierarchy
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Include metadata in files

2. File Format
   - Use tab-separated values
   - One word pair per line
   - UTF-8 encoding required
   - No empty lines or comments

3. Folder Structure
   - Organize by difficulty level
   - Group by themes
   - Support nested categories
   - Clear naming scheme

### State Management
1. Controlled Components
   - Pass selection state through props
   - Maintain single source of truth
   - Implement clear state update flows
   - Use props to drive component behavior

2. Component Communication
   - Define clear interfaces for component props
   - Use callback props for state updates
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions
   - Document component dependencies

3. Selection Management
   - Track selection state at appropriate level
   - Sync selection across components
   - Provide clear selection feedback
   - Implement robust clear/reset functionality

### UI/UX Guidelines
1. Folder Structure
   - Support nested hierarchies
   - Use clear visual indicators
   - Maintain consistent indentation
   - Handle deep nesting gracefully

2. Selection Interface
   - Provide clear selection indicators
   - Show aggregated selection counts
   - Enable bulk selection/deselection
   - Maintain selection visibility

3. Preview Functionality
   - Keep previews compact and readable
   - Show relevant information only
   - Handle large datasets efficiently
   - Provide clear expand/collapse controls

4. Game Navigation
   - Implement consistent back navigation
   - Show game type and word count in header
   - Use clear, accessible button styling
   - Maintain consistent color themes
   - Provide clear visual feedback for interactions

5. Game Selection Interface
   - Group games by category (Static/AI-Generated)
   - Use descriptive labels and icons
   - Show game descriptions
   - Maintain consistent button sizing
   - Use semantic color coding

### Error Prevention
1. State Synchronization
   - Verify state updates across components
   - Handle edge cases in selection
   - Prevent selection desync
   - Maintain consistent counts

2. Type Safety
   - Define comprehensive interfaces
   - Use proper TypeScript types
   - Handle optional properties
   - Validate prop types

3. User Feedback
   - Show clear selection status
   - Provide visual feedback
   - Handle empty states
   - Display error messages
